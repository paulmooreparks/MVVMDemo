# FileSystemViewer MVVM Demo

The next steps for this would probably be to add double-click support so that double-clicking 
on folder entries navigates into them and double-clicking on file entries opens them. Making 
the list view editable and updating the file system when the user changes the name of a file 
would be a nice feature, too. If I have time, I'll add those.
